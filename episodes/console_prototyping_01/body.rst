If your hobby is making a computer game, it's likely to take a while.
Which means that you will spend a good period of time referring to it as a
`work in progress`.

When people ask, it's important to show them that you're getting somewhere,
and also very useful to have early feedback on your ideas. What's needed
then, is a prototype which you can show people and talk about.
 
Prototyping a game is not the same as designing it. And it's certainly not the
same as testing it. Prototyping is useful for taking the risk out of an idea.
To prove that certain objectives you have are within your capability. To see if
a new mechanic works well in the context of the game. And the prototype can be
a talking point to help create interest or increase awareness of your project.

Today I'm going to show you what an early game prototype might look like, and
I'll demonstrate a couple of the mechanics of a game I'm working on called
Addison Arches.

First though, we'll look at how easy it is to put an interactive prototype
together. Now, in my case, I'm developing in the Python language, which has a
standard module for doing interactive text programs.
